# Todo List
This is my first hand project on learning and building a web applicatiion using Vite + React framework 
as the build tool. The application is called "Todo-List" and it's purpose is to allow users  to create,
 update, delete tasks.
 I have followed through the tutorial provided by "Web Dev Simplified" on his youtube channel and here
 is the link to the video :

 I went further and deployed the "Todo-List" on my github pages covering another scope of learning 
 deployment of  applications in real world scenarios. Here is the link to the Github Pages page:
